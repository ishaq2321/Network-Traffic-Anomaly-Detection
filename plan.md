# Project Plan: Network Traffic Anomaly Detection

## Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning system to detect anomalies in network traffic data, which can indicate cybersecurity threats or unusual network behavior. The workflow will be divided into clear phases to ensure systematic progress and learning.

---

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Data Acquisition
- Define project objectives and deliverables
- Identify and download a suitable public dataset (e.g., NSL-KDD, KDD Cup 1999, CICIDS2017)
- Explore dataset structure and features

## Phase 2: Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- Clean and preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categorical features, normalization)
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations
- Visualize key statistics and patterns

## Phase 3: Feature Engineering
- Select relevant features for anomaly detection
- Create new features if beneficial (e.g., ratios, aggregations)
- Dimensionality reduction if needed (PCA, t-SNE)

## Phase 4: Unsupervised Anomaly Detection
- Apply unsupervised algorithms (Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM, DBSCAN, KMeans)
- Visualize detected anomalies
- Evaluate results using available labels (if any)

## Phase 5: Supervised Classification (if labeled data available)
- Train classification models (Random Forest, SVM, etc.)
- Evaluate using precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
- Compare with unsupervised results

## Phase 6: Model Evaluation & Visualization
- Summarize model performance
- Visualize results (confusion matrix, ROC curve, anomaly plots)
- Discuss strengths and limitations

## Phase 7: Documentation & Reporting
- Write a concise README/report explaining the approach, challenges, and results
- List dependencies and setup instructions

> **Note:** Each phase will be documented and implemented in a Jupyter notebook for clarity and reproducibility.
